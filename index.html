                Chess boxing or chessboxing is a hybrid fighting sport that combines the two traditional sports, chess and boxing. The competitors fight in alternating rounds of chess and boxing. Chessboxing was invented by Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh in 2003. What was initially only thought to be an art performance quickly turned into a fully developed competitive sport. [1] Chessboxing is particularly popular in Germany, Great Britain, India and Russia.<br><br>A chessboxing fight consists of 11 rounds, 6 rounds of chess and 5 rounds of boxing. Chess and boxing rounds alternate, beginning and ending with a round of chess. Both, chess and boxing rounds, last 3 minutes. The total amount of chess playing time is 18 minutes, making it 9 minutes each player. After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks in between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.
